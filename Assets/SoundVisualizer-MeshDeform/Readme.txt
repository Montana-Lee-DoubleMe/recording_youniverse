Sound Visualizer - Mesh Deformation

------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: 
===
Features:
- Get data from playing AudioSource and split it on 8 accurate channels. Channel diapasons depend on <strong>hearing</strong> diapasons. Where 0 - bass and 8 - high frequencies. You can always change it on your own.
- Four ways to access audio data:
  1) RAW data from channel; 
  2) Smoothed raw data (to avoid flickering);
  3) Normalized data from channel (0..1);
  4) Buffered normalized data.
- Falling maximum values for better data normalization.

- Mesh deformation as example
- Mesh deformation based on Pelin Noise
- Mesh deformation based on choice of mesh's vertex 
- Splitting mesh into triangles
- Editable size, scale force and type of deformation
- Iso-Sphere prefab included (with usual and reversed normals)
- Current geometry and speed of deformation depend on playing audio data
- Full sources included
- Ready-to-go asset. Easily deployable in existing project.
- Developed with love <3

Full example of using included in package as Demo scene.
